== Overview

Custom login form that overrides the default one used by Apache Sling.

Apache Sling Auth Core (`org.apache.sling.auth.core`) and Apache Sling Form Based Authentication (`org.apache.sling.auth.form`) deliver a default HTML login form. Additionally, those packages allow for overriding the default form with a custom form supplied in an OSGi fragment attached to `org.apache.sling.auth.form` bundle. This bundle delivers such a form and attaches itself to the mentioned bundle, effectively replacing the default login interface.
